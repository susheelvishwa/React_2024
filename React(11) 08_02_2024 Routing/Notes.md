># Routing - Introduction, Installation & Setup,BrowserRouter, Routes, Route and Link

>## Introduction :

Routing basically means you navigate between different pages of your application.

>## Introduction to Routing in React with `react-router-dom` :

Routing in React enables navigation between different components in an application, simulating the experience of moving between pages in a multi-page web application. `react-router-dom` is a popular library that facilitates routing in React applications.

>## A quick overview of steps we are gonna follow to build an application using `react-router-dom` library

**Step 1 - Installation:**
To use `react-router-dom`, first, install it in your React project. If you're using Vite, create a new project and install `react-router-dom`:

```jsx
npm init vite@latest <application-name> -- --template react
npm install react-router-dom
```

**Step 2 - `BrowserRouter`:**`BrowserRouter` is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

**Step 3 - `Routes` and `Route` Component:**`Routes` replaces the older `Switch` component and is used to declare routes in your application. `Route` components inside `Routes` define individual routes.

**Step 4 - `Link` Component:**`Link` is used for navigation within your app. It's similar to HTML's `<a>` tag but is designed for React Router.

**Step 5 - Dynamic Routes and `useParams` Hook:**
Dynamic routing is achieved using route parameters. `useParams` is a hook that allows you to access these parameters.

**Step 6 - `Navigate` Component and `useNavigate` Hook:**`Navigate` is a component used for redirecting to another route. `useNavigate` is a hook that programmatically navigates users around.

>Introducrion

Routing is essential in single-page applications (SPAs) to navigate between different views or components without reloading the entire page. This makes the user experience smoother and more app-like.

># Step 1 - Installation:
To use `react-router-dom`, first, install it in your React project. If you're using Vite, create a new project and install `react-router-dom`:

```jsx
npm init vite@latest <application-name> -- --template react
npm install react-router-dom
```


># Step 2 - BrowserRouter

*Purpose*: Keeps the UI in sync with the URL

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      {/* Your routes and components here */}
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

># Step 3 - Routes and Route Components
*Purpose*: Routes component manages multiple Route components, which define paths and the components to render for those paths.

```javascript
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

># Step 4 - Link Component
*Purpose*: Provides navigation between routes without reloading the page, similar to an anker tag in HTML but optimized for React Router.

```javascript
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```


># Step 5 - Dynamic Routes and useParams Hook
Purpose: Dynamic routes allow for URLs with variable parts  useParams hook accesses these dynamic parts.

```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function Article() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <div>Article ID: {id}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/article/:id" element={<Article />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

># Step 6 - Navigate Component and useNavigate Hook

Purpose: Navigate component is used for redirecting users to another route declaratively. useNavigate hook provides programmatic navigation.


# Navigation

```javascript
  import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProtectedRoute({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

# useNavigation

```Javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function Login() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  function handleLogin() {
    // Perform login logic
    navigate('/dashboard');
  }

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>;
}
```
># React Router: Use-Case & Benefits

## Use-Case

React Router is a powerful library used in React applications to manage navigation and rendering of components based on URL paths. It's particularly useful for:

- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: SPAs rely on dynamic loading of content without refreshing the entire page. React Router facilitates this by handling client-side routing, allowing the app to update the UI based on the current URL.
- **Nested Routing**: It allows for defining nested routes, making it easier to manage complex UIs with multiple layers of navigation.
- **Parameter Handling**: React Router enables the capture of URL parameters and query strings, which can be used to render specific data or components.

## Benefits

1. **Smooth Navigation**:
    - **No Full Page Reloads**: React Router ensures smooth transitions between different views of the application without needing to reload the entire page. This enhances user experience by providing faster and more seamless navigation.
  
2. **Centralized Route Management**:
    - **Organized Structure**: By defining all routes in a centralized location, React Router helps in maintaining a clear and organized structure of the application. This makes the codebase easier to manage and understand.
    - **Consistent Navigation Logic**: Centralized routes ensure that the navigation logic is consistent across the application, reducing the likelihood of routing-related bugs.

3. **Dynamic Routing**:
    - **Parameterization**: Routes can be parameterized, allowing dynamic rendering based on URL segments. For example, `/user/:id` can render different user profiles based on the `id` parameter.
    - **Conditional Rendering**: Components can be conditionally rendered based on the route, allowing for more complex and dynamic UIs.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
    - **Faster Load Times**: By avoiding full page reloads, React Router significantly reduces load times for subsequent navigations.
    - **State Preservation**: Application state can be preserved across route changes, providing a more consistent and engaging user experience.

5. **Development Efficiency**:
    - **Code Splitting**: React Router supports lazy loading and code splitting, which can improve performance and reduce the initial load time of the application.
    - **Integration with Redux**: React Router can be easily integrated with state management libraries like Redux, allowing for more sophisticated state handling and UI updates based on route changes.

## Conclusion

React Router is an essential tool for any React developer looking to build modern, efficient, and user-friendly single-page applications. Its ability to handle complex routing scenarios while maintaining a seamless user experience makes it a critical component in the React ecosystem.

## Real World Examples

- A blog website where users can navigate between home, about, and article pages.
- An e-commerce site with product listings, product detail pages, and a shopping cart.

# Routing - `Navigate` Component and `useNavigate` Hook

## Introduction

In this lesson, we extend our understanding of React's routing capabilities by exploring the `Navigate` component and `useNavigate` hook from the `react-router-dom` library. These tools allow for programmatic navigation, giving developers control over redirecting users under certain conditions.

## Detailed Explanation

- **`Navigate` Component**: Used for immediate redirection. When rendered, it navigates to a specified route.
- **`useNavigate` Hook**: Provides a function that can be called to programmatically navigate the user.

## Use-case & Benefits

- **Conditional Redirects**: Redirect users based on certain conditions (e.g., authentication status).
- **Event-Driven Navigation**: Navigate after certain actions like form submissions.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Smoothly guide users through application flows.

## Real World Examples

- Redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page.
- Navigating to a different page after a certain task is done or say a new resource is created.

## Usage

1. **`Navigate` Component**: Use it in a component's render method for immediate redirection.
2. **`useNavigate` Hook**: Call the navigate function to redirect users in response to events.

## Simplified Explanation

The `Navigate` component or `useNavigate` hook is generally used to programmatically navigate/move the user to a different location.  

But how is it different from the `Link` component that we already have? Let’s try and understand.

As a developer, you will often need to navigate/move users to different pages programmatically. That is when the `Navigate` tool can be super helpful.

### Difference from `Link`

- **`Link` Component**: When a user wants to go to some page, they click on that particular link and go there. (User has the control; they choose to go to that page).
- **`Navigate` Component and `useNavigate` Hook**: There are times when it’s not up to the user, but the developer needs to navigate them to a different route programmatically.

### Example

A user has not logged in (is not authenticated) and is trying to access the `home page`. As a developer, you’d navigate the user to the `login page`.

```jsx
// src/pages/Home.jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Home() {
  const isLoggedIn = false;

  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    return <Navigate to="/about" />;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default Home;
```
